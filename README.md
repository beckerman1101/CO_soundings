Pretty simple stuff here, just a short jupyter notebook (meant to be run in Colab) to generate soundings local to the Colorado Front Range and adjacent plains using the sounderpy framework and widgets.

I mostly plan on using it to make severe wx/chase forecasts easier, but good tool for local forecasts all around.
