Pretty simple stuff here, just a short jupyter notebook (meant to be run in Colab) to generate soundings local to the Colorado Front Range and adjacent plains using the sounderpy framework and widgets.

A few things: the widgets aren't meant for github, so the script won't even load here. Download the file, upload it to your Google Drive, and then open it from Drive (this'll take you to Colab, and rendering soundings from there is pretty simple)

I mostly plan on using it to make severe wx/chase forecasts easier, but good tool for local forecasts all around.
